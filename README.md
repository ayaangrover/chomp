In addition, a [sample web interface](https://ayaangrover.is-a.dev/chomp/frontend/) is provided to interact with the [API](https://chomp.onrender.com/).

## AI Usage

AI was used as an assisant for this project, mostly for quick styling(the webpage wasn't the focus of the project). AI was used on the [docs](https://chomp.apidocumentation.com/), which were made with [Scalar](https://scalar.com/).
